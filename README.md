ISAT 340 Project Final Exam

Ian Lawson and Rachel Vanlandingham

Welcome to our mini-project repository! This project is a web application built using Flask and Python. The application allows users to browse and view information about members and celebrities stored in a SQLite database.

The repository contains all the necessary files to run the application. In addition to our Python script, FlaskAppProject.py, we have included a templates folder containing all of our HTML templates, and a static folder containing our stylesheet and image files. We have also included the SQLite database file, celebrities.db, which contains all the celebrity data.

To run the application, please follow the instructions provided above. We have also included a screenshot of the application's homepage in the repository, named example.jpg, so you can see what the application looks like before running it.



To use the web application, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository from GitHub.
2. Ensure that you have Python and Flask installed on your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the command "python FlaskAppProject.py" in the terminal to start the Flask server.
5. Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to "http://localhost:5000/" to access the web application.
